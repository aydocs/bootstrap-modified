## Example button with enhanced styles

<a class="btn-posnawr primary" href="#">Enhanced Button <span></span></a>

<!-- Example responsive grid layout -->
<!-- This is an example of a responsive grid layout. The layout uses the 12-column Bootstrap grid system.
     It contains two columns inside a 'row'. 
     Each column is set to take 6 columns on medium-sized screens (md), 
     so when the screen width is 768px or larger, the columns will take half the width each. -->
<div class="row">
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <!-- The 'col-md-6' class ensures that this column will take up half the width on medium screens (768px and above). -->
    <p>This is a responsive column!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="col-md-6">
    <!-- The second column will also take up 50% of the width, making it responsive to screen sizes. -->
    <p>This is another responsive column!</p>
  </div>
</div>
